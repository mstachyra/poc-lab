# odata-ef-core

A simple example of using the [OData](https://github.com/OData/AspNetCoreOData) library together with [EF Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/get-started/overview/first-app?tabs=netcore-cli). In addition, a [SQL database project](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/ssdt/) based on the publicly available [AdventureWorks2022](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/tag/adventureworks) database has been added to the solution. EFCore models were generated using [EFCore Power Tools](https://github.com/ErikEJ/EFCorePowerTools).
